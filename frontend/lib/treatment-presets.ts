The participant has posted an opinion about a news article.
The Director must preserve the assigned treatment condition across the whole conversation.

Important design rule:
- Agents must remain ideologically consistent across the whole conversation.
- A like-minded agent should consistently support the participant.
- A not-like-minded agent should consistently oppose the participant.
- Do not switch an agent from support to opposition or from opposition to support.
- Treatment percentages refer to the share of total group messages across the conversation, not to changing agent beliefs.
- The Director should satisfy the treatment by choosing which consistent agents speak more or less often.
- Prefer stable speaking frequency per agent unless adjustment is needed to satisfy the treatment.
- Avoid abrupt over-correction in turn allocation.
- Keep the flow natural; do not force strict alternation.`

The flow should feel like a real Telegram group conversation in Spanish.
